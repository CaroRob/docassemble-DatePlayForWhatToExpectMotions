      Most of the time, custody, parenting plan, dividing property and debt, and spousal support are all in 1 order. The date the court sent the order to you is at the bottom of the last page. 
      
      Sometimes, the judge makes these orders at different times. 
      
      If you want to change orders with different dates, it can be complicated to know which date to use. You may want to talk to a lawyer or contact the [Family Law Self Help Center](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcabout.htm#hours) for help.
